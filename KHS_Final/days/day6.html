            <h2>Body oil Massage</h2>
            <p> A body massage can release tension from the body physically and mentally. If you are someone
                that does a lot of strenious activities, you might feel tension on the upper back,
                or other parts of the body. This physical pain can affect the individual mentally, leading
                to increased stress and discomfort. Body massages with essential oils can help
                physically remove this tension and allow the individual to promote relaxation and reduce
                mental strains. This is a form of aromatherapy because when essential oils are added to massage oils, 
                they are absorbed through the skin and inhaled. This dual mode of delivery—both through the skin and 
                the olfactory system—can have a profound effect on both physical and mental health.

            <h3>TO DO: </h3>
            <p>
                1.  You could either go to a massage clinic that specialized in therapuetic 
                    massages or you could do this at home with the help of another person.

                2. Use 3-4 drops of lavendar essentail oil to a teaspoon of a base Oil
                   such as almond oil, olive oil or sunflower and jojoba carrier oils. This
                   is where you want to massage that conconction to the areas where you feel
                   the most tension. This usually includes the neck, back, shoulders and 
                   lower back. Remember to smell in the aroma as well.

                3. You can save the mixture in a small vial and store it in a dark
                   glass bottle in room temperature so you can use it again.
