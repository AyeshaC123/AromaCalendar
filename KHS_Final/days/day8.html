            <h3>To do: </h3>
            <p>
                1.  Purchase an aromatic candle or room spray. Here are some examples of good ones:
                    *Lavendar 
                    *Peppermint and Eucalyptus spray
                    *Rosemary
                    *Tea tree 
                    *Chamomile and Bergamot Spray
                

                2. Spray the room spray or light the candle around the room you plan to use. Make sure not
                   to spray too much as that can trigger nausea. 4-5 sprays in a medium sized room is fine.
