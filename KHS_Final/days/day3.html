            <h2>History of Aroma Therapy</h2>
            <p>
                The most common item used for Aroma Therapy are essential oils. Essential oils have been utilized
                for therapy and stress relief for as long as 6,000 years. 
                The benefits of lavender oil were more recently found by French chemist René-Maurice Gattefossé, who used it to
                treat a burn on his hand that resulted from an explosion in his lab. He then began researching the chemical makeup of essential oils and their application in
                treating burns, skin infections, gangrene, and wounds sustained by soldiers in the First World War. Gattefossé established the field of aromatherapy in 1928. 
                Aromatherapy was used by doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, massage therapists, beauticians, and other medical professionals by the 1950s.

                They were employed in cosmetics, fragrances, and medications by the ancient Chinese, Indians, 
                Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. In addition, essential oils were frequently employed in ritualistic,
                medicinal, sanitary, and spiritual contexts.
