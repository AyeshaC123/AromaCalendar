        <h1>Day 9: Aromatic Pillow</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Aromatic Pillow Therapy</h2>
            <p> Sleep is a very integral part of reducing stress levels and anxiety throughout a busy day. Having improper sleep
                can be an effect of stress and worries throughout the day, they both go hand in hand. One way to do this is to drop 
                aromatic oils and scents onto your pillow before sleeping. Lavendar essential oil has actually been the most prefered 
                oil when it comes to pillow scenting. Many studies have been done to prove its effectiveness.

            <h3>To do: </h3>
            <p>
                1.  Purchase an pillow mist or make your own through these steps!   
                    
                2. Ingredients:
                    1 oz Witch Hazel
                    1 oz Distilled Water
                    20-30 drops of calming essential oils
                    2 or 4 ounce Amber Glass Spray Bottle
                    Funnel
                    To use: Spray 3-4 times onto your pillow before laying down.  This mixture contains approximately 2% dilution rate (when using 24 drops of essential oils), which also makes it safe for spritzing lightly onto the body or pajamas of most adults.  If you would like to use it directly on pregnant women or children, I would recommend selecting extra-safe essential oils and reducing the dilution rate to 1% (12 drops) or less.

                3. It can be sprayed directly on the pillow or used as room mist. A little lavender essential oil goes a long way, so if you're making your own, make sure you only add 1ml lavender essential oil for every 120ml pillow mist.
                   Too much oil can leave stains on your pillowcases
