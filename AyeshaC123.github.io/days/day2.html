            <h2>What is Aroma Therapy</h2>
            <p>
                Aroma Therapy is a stress relieving activity that involves using essential oils or natural scents from natural sources such as plants, or nature to relax and heal.
                .While the term "aroma" suggests that the oils are inhaled or injested in some way, they can also be applied topically on the skin or, in different places to fill the room with aroma. Never consume essential oils internally without a doctor's explicit instructions from a licensed and experienced practitioner.
            </p>
            <p>
                Essential oils are becoming more well-known as an alternative therapy for infections, stress, and other medical issues, whether they are 
                administered topically or breathed.
