                Our first type of aroma therapy is using Lavendar oil. Lavendar oil is of the commonly used/adaptable essential oils. Lavandula angustifolia oil,
                which is taken by extracting the distilled water from the plant, is known to induce relaxation and has been clinically 
                researched as a treatment for stress, anxiety, depression, and maybe other illnesses.

                Anxiety: Based on numerous studies and research on the Lavender plant, it
                has been concluded that utilizing lavendar oil, in any way it interacts with the body,
                does significantly reduce anxiety. An example of this study is shown here:

                Another notable research conducted was using lavendar oil to reduce
                the anxiety of being in a doctors office. A study was conducted in 2005
                on 200 people that were in a dentist office awaiting for treatment. The study found 
                that the scent of lavender lessended both their anxiety and improved mood.
