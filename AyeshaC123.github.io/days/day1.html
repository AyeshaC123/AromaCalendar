            <h2>Understanding Stress and Its Impact</h2>
            <p>
                Stress is a common response to challenging or threatening situations, and it activates the body's "fight or flight" response. While short-term stress can be beneficial for dealing with immediate threats, chronic stress can have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health. It can stem from various sources such as work pressures, relationship issues, financial difficulties, or health concerns.
            </p>
            <p>
                The body's reaction to stress includes the release of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, which can increase heart rate, elevate blood pressure, and boost energy levels. Managing stress effectively through techniques like exercise, relaxation, proper sleep, and seeking social support is crucial for maintaining overall well-being.

            <h2>Overview of the Stress Reduction Tool</h2>
            <p>
                My stress reduction tool is an interactive calendar that I programmed from scratch. It is meant to inform the user on the benefits of Aromatherapy. Some benefits of using this tool is being able to have an already pre planned calendar that schedules your days along with stress relieving activities relating to aromatherapy. It also informs the user on Aromatherapy and includes helpful links and images. The application is very user friendly and overall is a great easy and reusable tool for users looking to lessen their daily stress.

            <h2>The proper way or ways to use/engage this calendar</h2>
            <p>
                This interactive calendar includes 30 days and 30 different activities relating to aromatherapy. The user is able to click on any day and they are taken to a new page that talks about that activity in detail so the user can be better informed. Depending on the activity, each activity day contains steps, an overview or some helpful links.
